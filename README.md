Written with Qt 5.12, tested on Linux Mint 20.0

# Gameplay
## General
* If you get all right for 3 rounds in a row, you enter the next level, with one extra tile.
* If you failed 3 times in a level, you drop to the previous level.

## Intro Mode
* numbers are shown
* take your time to remember their positions (order doesn't matter)
![Preview for Level 10](screenshots/intro-preview.png)
* click on any number
* boxes show up all over the screen obscuring the numbers
![Preview for Level 10](screenshots/intro-covered.png)
* you have to find all numbers without mistakes

* now the other numbers get hidden
* click on the tiles in the correct order

## Challange Mode
Like Training Mode, but tiles with are shown only for a very short time (increasing with O(nÂ²) ).


# TODO
## Ayumu Challange Mode - Pro
* like Ayumu Challange Mode,
* but with fixed 9 numbers and 0.5 seconds

## Chimpanzee Colors
* implement color themes
* add black/white themes

## Reward Dispenser
Build a machine with USB connection, which dispenses small amounts of some tasty food.

## Mode specific high score
Currently all modes are treated the same regarding score counting.
